The Memories web app is a fullstack MERN application. This application is created for storing your most favourite memories. The text section within each post can provide context to the memory. It can also be used to describe your emotions when you experienced that day. The photo section can further visualize your treasured memories.

* Handles and dispatches HTTP request from NodeJs server using Express
* Integrates CRUD operations like creating, liking, deleting and editing a memory post with MongoDB.
* Uses React, Redux and Material UI to create the front-end resulting in a modern responsive UI in a MERN
stack web application.
